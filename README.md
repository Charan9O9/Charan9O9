# 👋 Hi, I’m Charan Mouli  
🔧 **DevOps Engineer** | 8+ years of experience  
🚀 Automating infrastructure, scaling systems, and enabling continuous delivery  

## 👀 What gets me out of bed:  
- Building *scalable* and *super-efficient* CI/CD pipelines (because manual deployments give me nightmares 🌚)  
- Writing Infrastructure as Code (Terraform is basically my third language!)  
- Going cloud-native on AWS 🌩️ (cue the dramatic cloud music 🎶)  
- Orchestrating containers with Kubernetes and Docker (The conductor of my own DevOps symphony 🎻)  

## 🌱 Currently leveling up in:  
- Mastering the dark arts of Kubernetes with Helm & ArgoCD 🧙‍♂️  
- Supercharging monitoring with Datadog & Prometheus (Because I like knowing *everything* that's going on 🕵️)  
- Diving deep into serverless & event-driven architectures (Serverless, because why not just... not have a server?)  

##  Looking to team up on:  
- DevOps open-source projects 🛠️ (because sharing is caring)  
- Automating cloud infrastructure like it’s going out of style 🌐  
- Building CI/CD pipelines for microservices (I’m practically a pipeline whisperer)

## 😄 Pronouns: He/Him  

## ⚡ Fun fact:  
When I’m not busy automating the world, you’ll either find me:  
1. Exploring off-the-beaten-path travel spots 🗺️ (Bonus points if they have good coffee ☕)  
2. Cruising on my bike, pretending I’m in a road trip movie 🏍️ (Wind in my hair, but also, wearing a helmet because safety first!)  
3. Trying to explain what I do to non-tech friends… they still think I “just fix computers” 😅
